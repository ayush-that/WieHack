            What You Should Know About Sexual Harassment
          </div>
          <div class="answer">
            a.Sexual harassment can happen anywhere- whether in a public space,
            in a workplace or even at home.

            <br />
            b.Sexual harassment need not always be physical. Even non-physical
            acts like words, gestures, actions, etc. which have a sexual
            implication can amount to sexual harassment.

            <br />
            c. Anyone can be a sexual harasser (It is not always an stranger in
            a public place who is a sexual harasser). Sometimes, it can be
            people whom you don’t expect to do so- like, a colleague at work or
            an uncle at home.

            Sexual Harassment That Is Difficult To Identify:
          </div>
          <div class="answer">
            Sexual harassment has been made so ‘normal’ and accepted in our
            society, that often women don’t realise that a particular behaviour
            amounts to sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is easy to identify
            when it happens in a public place or by an unknown stranger (for
            example, on a bus or metro or the street). But, in certain
            situations, sexual harassment is difficult to identify, like: If it
            happens at home/ your workplace If it is non-physical sexual
            harassment (like words or gestures) In such situations, women often
            try to brush it off thinking, ‘He didn’t mean to... In such
            situations, women often try to reason out that ‘He didn’t mean to
            sexually harass me, I am just over-thinking, or I have misunderstood
            him.’ Stop yourself right there. Just ask yourself- Does it check
            any of the above boxes? Did it make you feel uncomfortable? If your
            inner voice says yes, that means it is sexual harassment. Remember,
            you don’t feel uncomfortable around every man or in every
            interaction with a man. But if this particular man (remove comma) or
            this particular…

          <div class="question">Examples of Sexual Harassment:</div>
          <div class="answer">
            Physical Harassment: Groping you, i.e. touching/squeezing your body
            parts like breasts, buttocks, thighs, etc. (usually happens in
            public transport/crowded places). Touching you anywhere on your
            body, like touching your face, touching your lips, holding your
            hand, putting his arm around your waist or your shoulder, which
            makes you uncomfortable. Kissing you or hugging you or rubbing his
            body against you. Trying to remove any part of your clothing. Trying
            to put his hands under your clothing, like putting his hands inside
            your t-shirt/kurta. Using physical force to do any of the above

          <div class="question">Non-physical Harassment (words/gestures):</div>
          <div class="answer">
            Whistling at you (usually in the case of eve-teasing on streets).
            Singing songs with the intent of teasing/troubling you (usually in
            the case of eve-teasing on streets) Calling you names which have a
            sexual suggestion like ‘item,’ ‘bomb,’ ‘mirchi,’ ‘pataka,’ ‘sexy,’
            ‘maal,’ etc. You will identify these kinds of words instantly when
            you hear them, especially with the tone in which they are said.
            Staring at you/staring at your body parts like breasts, buttocks,
            etc. Showing you pornographic content or sending you pornographic
            content over whatsapp, social media, email, messages, etc. Telling
            you adult jokes or cracking adult jokes in your presence, knowing
            that it will make you uncomfortable. Adult jokes can be shared
            between close friends who have a comfortable rapport with each
            other. But if a male person is not a close friend, he should not be
            sharing such content with you unless you have told him that it is
            okay. Passing comments about your body or your looks like- ‘you have
            a beautiful body,’ ‘you have great lips,’ ‘you have a sexy butt,’ ‘I
            like the shape of your body,’ ‘you look sexy,’ ‘your legs are
            looking sexy,’ etc. Even sending you messages with such comments
            (whether through whatsapp, social media, email, etc.) is sexual
            harassment. Sending you messages over text message/whatsapp/social
            media/email, etc. about anything related to your body or looks or
            anything which has a sexual suggestion. Making suggestive hand
            gestures like cupping of breasts/buttocks, biting of lips, kissing
            gestures, etc. Making vulgar faces at you.
