          <div class="question">1. What is a police complaint ?</div>
          <div class="answer">A police complaint is a first-hand account of any offence or crime, which describes in layman’s words what happened.
        Basically, it is a narration of facts about the incident. See how to write a police complaint below</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="question">2. What is the purpose of a police complaint</div>
          <div class="answer">The police can start an investigation and lodge an FIR only after you give the complaint. It can also be used as
          evidence in the criminal trial. Filing a complaint shows that you are genuinely affected by the incident and wish to
          report it; it will help to prove your case better</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="question">3. What is the difference between a police complaint and an FIR?</div>
          <div class="answer">A police complaint contains the narration of facts and the incident which a complainant gives to the police. An FIR is
          the first report made by the police about the offence after you make a police complaint. An FIR is only made for
          cognizable offences ( glossary). For further details on FIR, see FIR</div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="question">4. Who Can File A Police Complaint?</div>
        <div class="answer">Anyone can file a police complaint- whether it is the victim, victim’s family/friends, or any witness to a crime. Therefore, if you know someone who is a victim of any crime, you can file a police complaint on their behalf (if the victim will not have a problem with that).</div>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="question">5. Where Should I File A Police Complaint?</div>
        <div class="answer">You should file the police complaint in the jurisdiction where the crime is committed. For example, if the incident occurs in Jubilee Hills, Hyderabad, you should go to the Jubilee Hills police station. You can find out which police station has jurisdiction through a simple google search. In case of urgency, for a cognizable offence( glossary), i.e. for serious offences like rape, you can file a complaint in any police station. The police will have to register a Zero FIR immediately.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="question">6. Can I File A Police Complaint Without Going To The Police Station?</div>
        <div class="answer">Yes, you can write/type your complaint and send it to the police station through Registered Post Acknowledgment Due. Address it to a senior police officer of the level of Deputy Commissioner or Commissioner of Police. The officer then directs the Station House Officer (of the police station of the area where the incident occurred) to lodge an FIR or conduct an investigation. The police may then come over to the residence of the victim/person giving the complaint, to take her statement.
        
        Nowadays, many police stations in metro cities let you file a complaint online- through email or their app. You can do a simple google search to find out if this facility is available in your city. The police departments in some metro cities have launched mobile applications through which one can easily register FIR even without going to the police station, like Delhi (Himmat) and Hyderabad (Hawk Eye).</div>

    <div class="faq-container">
      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="question">10. What if I don’t know which legal provisions apply to my police complaint?</div>
        <div class="answer">No documents are necessary to file a police complaint. Oral information is enough, and as explained above(see procedure), the police will write down the complaint for you. If you have any evidence, for example, photographs or medical reports (in case of domestic violence), you can always submit it to the police along with your complaint. But this is not compulsory.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="question">11. Do I need to show any documents to file a police complaint?</div>
        <div class="answer">The police can start an investigation and lodge an FIR only after you give the complaint. It can
          also be used as
          evidence in the criminal trial. Filing a complaint shows that you are genuinely affected by the incident and wish
          to
          report it; it will help to prove your case better</div>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="question">12. Does a police complaint need to be typed or hand-written?</div>
        <div class="answer">It can be typed or hand-written, based on your convenience. If hand-written, make sure you write it neatly and your handwriting is clear.</div>
